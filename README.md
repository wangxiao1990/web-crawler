# web-crawler
Take an internet domain name(i.e. “jana.com”) and print out a list of the email addresses that were found on that website.

To run this program, you need to have "jre1.7" installed and both "lib" and "WebCrawler.jar" under the same directory. Then you are good to go.

To run this program in command line, please type "java -jar WebCrawler.jar jana.com" under the same directory that you put "WebCrawler.jar". The "jana.com" is just a format, you could type any domain name as you want.

Of course, if you installed Eclipse, things would be easier :)

Having fun!
